# Week-2-Mini-Project

##Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:
~ I built a page for CSS Snippets of code in HTML. I styled the page in CSS. I built the code to be semantic, well structured, accessible, have sequential headings, and have a descriptive title.

Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
~ I am learning to make code semantic, well structured, accessible, and descriptive. I am also learning to style with CSS.

What problem does it solve?
~ This project is practice for writing my own code, to better structure it according to best practices for semantics and accessibility. It also serves as a place to keep my notes.

What did you learn?
~ Doing this project taught me some new HTML code, and some new CSS features. I learned how to use the flex, hover, before, after, align, and justify tags in new ways, which was exciting! I have gotten more used to Git Bash through this project. I also found that putting my notes in the comments after practicing and learning new code was very helpful for me to remember everything I learned, and explaining what I changed will make it easier to come back to this code, or for other devs to see what I did.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.
~ I followed the user story and acceptance criteria from the DU coding bootcamp.
